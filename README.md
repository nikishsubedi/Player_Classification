# Player_Classification
This notebook demonstrated the use of transfer learning (feature extraction) among other many concepts like data augmentation using Python and Tensorflow. The model built can classify the given image of player provided that they are from Manchester City, Liverpool and Manchester United and are wearing their correspondig club jersey. The model has about 75% accuracy which is good (not best) given that small number of dataset was used for training.
